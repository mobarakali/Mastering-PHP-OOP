### 1. Learn how to define a class and create objects.

## Defining a Class and Creating Objects in PHP

In PHP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines properties (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can use. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to define a class and create objects:

### 1. Define a Class

A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, you define properties and methods.

#### Example: Define a Class

```php
<?php
class Book {
    // Properties
    public $title;
    public $author;
    public $pages;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($title, $author, $pages) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
        $this->pages = $pages;
    }

    // Method
    public function info() {
        return "The book titled '{$this->title}' is written by {$this->author} and has {$this->pages} pages.";
    }
}
?>
```

### 2. Create Objects

To create an object from a class, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class name. This process is known as instantiation. You can then access the properties and methods of the object using the arrow `->` operator.

#### Example: Create Objects and Use Them

```php
<?php
// Create objects
$book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 328);
$book2 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 281);

// Access properties
echo $book1->title; // Output: 1984
echo $book2->author; // Output: Harper Lee

// Call methods
echo $book1->info(); // Output: The book titled '1984' is written by George Orwell and has 328 pages.
echo $book2->info(); // Output: The book titled 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is written by Harper Lee and has 281 pages.
?>
```

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition**:
    - `class Book` defines a new class named `Book`.
    - Inside the class, properties `$title`, `$author`, and `$pages` are declared. They represent the state of the object.
    - A constructor method `__construct` is defined. This method is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the properties of the object.
    - The `info` method returns a string with information about the book.

2. **Creating Objects**:
    - `$book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 328);` creates a new object of the `Book` class and initializes it with the given values.
    - Similarly, `$book2 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 281);` creates another object.

3. **Accessing Properties and Methods**:
    - `$book1->title` accesses the `title` property of the `$book1` object.
    - `$book2->info()` calls the `info` method of the `$book2` object.

### Practice

Try defining other classes and creating objects. Use the classes and methods provided earlier in this document as a guide. For instance:

#### Practice Example: Define and Create a `Car` Class

```php
<?php
class Car {
    // Properties
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    // Method
    public function getDetails() {
        return "This car is a {$this->year} {$this->make} {$this->model}.";
    }
}

// Create objects
$car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
$car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2018);

// Call methods
echo $car1->getDetails(); // Output: This car is a 2020 Toyota Corolla.
echo $car2->getDetails(); // Output: This car is a 2018 Honda Civic.
?>
```

By defining various classes and creating objects, you'll get comfortable with the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP.


### 2. Understand properties and methods.

## Understanding Properties and Methods in PHP

In PHP, properties and methods are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They are used to define the characteristics and behaviors of a class.

#### Properties
Properties are variables that belong to a class. They define the attributes or data members of the class. Properties hold information about an object created from the class.

#### Methods
Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the behaviors or actions that an object created from the class can perform.

### Example: Understanding Properties and Methods

Let's define a simple class to illustrate properties and methods.

#### Step 1: Define a Class with Properties and Methods

```php
<?php
class Book {
    // Properties
    public $title;
    public $author;
    public $pages;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($title, $author, $pages) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
        $this->pages = $pages;
    }

    // Method
    public function info() {
        return "The book titled '{$this->title}' is written by {$this->author} and has {$this->pages} pages.";
    }
}
?>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Class Definition**: `class Book` defines a class named `Book`.

2. **Properties**:
   - `public $title;`: This property holds the title of the book.
   - `public $author;`: This property holds the author of the book.
   - `public $pages;`: This property holds the number of pages in the book.

3. **Constructor Method**:
   - The `__construct` method is a special method called automatically when an object is instantiated. It initializes the properties of the object.
   - `public function __construct($title, $author, $pages)` initializes the properties `$title`, `$author`, and `$pages` with the values provided when the object is created.

4. **Method**:
   - `public function info()` is a method that returns a string with information about the book.
   - It accesses the properties `$title`, `$author`, and `$pages` using `$this`, which refers to the current object.

#### Step 2: Create Objects and Use Properties and Methods

```php
<?php
// Create objects
$book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 328);
$book2 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 281);

// Access properties
echo $book1->title; // Output: 1984
echo $book2->author; // Output: Harper Lee

// Call methods
echo $book1->info(); // Output: The book titled '1984' is written by George Orwell and has 328 pages.
echo $book2->info(); // Output: The book titled 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is written by Harper Lee and has 281 pages.
?>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Creating Objects**:
   - `$book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 328);` creates a new object of the `Book` class and initializes it with the given values for title, author, and pages.
   - `$book2 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 281);` creates another object of the `Book` class.

2. **Accessing Properties**:
   - `$book1->title` accesses the `title` property of the `$book1` object and prints it.
   - `$book2->author` accesses the `author` property of the `$book2` object and prints it.

3. **Calling Methods**:
   - `$book1->info()` calls the `info` method of the `$book1` object and prints the returned string.
   - `$book2->info()` calls the `info` method of the `$book2` object and prints the returned string.

### Practice

Try defining other classes with properties and methods. Here are a few more examples:

#### Example: Define a `Car` Class

```php
<?php
class Car {
    // Properties
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    // Constructor
    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    // Method
    public function getDetails() {
        return "This car is a {$this->year} {$this->make} {$this->model}.";
    }
}

// Create objects
$car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
$car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2018);

// Call methods
echo $car1->getDetails(); // Output: This car is a 2020 Toyota Corolla.
echo $car2->getDetails(); // Output: This car is a 2018 Honda Civic.
?>
```

### Key Points

- **Properties** are variables within a class that hold data about an object.
- **Methods** are functions within a class that define actions an object can perform.
- The **constructor method** `__construct` initializes properties when an object is created.
- Use the `->` operator to access properties and call methods of an object.

By understanding and practicing these concepts, you'll become proficient in using properties and methods in PHP classes.
